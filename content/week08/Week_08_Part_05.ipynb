    "The simplest version of the biggest theorem in the subject:\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of the sum of a large i.i.d. sample is approximately normal, *regardless of the underlying distribution of the population*.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, let $X_1, X_2, \\ldots$ be i.i.d. and let $S_n = X_1 + X_2 + \\cdots + X_n$. If $n$ is large, the distribution of $S_n$ is approximately normal, *regardless of the distribution of each $X_i$.*\n",

    "**Question 1:** What's the big deal? What makes this so \"Central\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** If you understand sample sums then you also understand sample means. The theorem implies that the distribution of the mean of a large i.i.d. sample is roughly normal, *regardless of the distribution of the population*. That's gold for data scientists, because it allows us to make inferences based on the sample mean even when we don't know the distribution of the population (which is our typical situation).\n",

    "**Question 2:** Are we going to prove it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** No; it helps to have some measure theory first. The section on probability generating functions, which we skipped, gives a method for calculating the distribution of $S_n$ exactly if $X_i$ has a finite number of non-negative integer values, and in those cases you can see the normality appearing as you increase $n$. Later in the course we will give more of a justification. But it will still have a huge hole. Take some measure theory (e.g. Math 105) and then Stat 205A.\n",
