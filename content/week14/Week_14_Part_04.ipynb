    "In the last Part you saw that if you have a single random point $[Y ~~ X_1 ~~ X_2 ~~ \\cdots ~~ X_p]^T$, and you know its mean vector and covariance matrix, then you can find the best linear predictor of $Y$ in terms of the predictor variables $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p$. If the joint distribution of variables is multivariate normal then this is the best among all predictors.\n",

    "But data scientists rarely know all the parameters in the mean vector and covariance matrix. They have to estimate these quantities. For this they need observations on not just one point but many.\n",

Some models are sufficient to help us understand the data better and make good decisions. But if a model is very far from reality then its conclusions might lead to bad decisions, no matter how sophisticated the theory or computation involved."
