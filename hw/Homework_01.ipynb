    "In the United States, an individual's Social Security Number (SSN) is intended to be a unique indentifier for tax purposes and so on. Each SSN is a 9-digit number consisting of a set of three digits followed by a pair of digits followed by four digits, for example 123-45-6789. The digits don't have to be distinct.\n",

    "Until fairly recently, the first three digits were based on where the application for the SSN was filed (for example, the zip code where the individual was born). The next two were connected with when the application was filed. Thus it is sometimes possible to make a pretty good guess at portions of an individual's SSN if you know their date and place of birth.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for security, it's important that it not be easy to guess parts of the number. So the Social Security Administration has introduced what it calls [SSN Randomization](https://www.ssa.gov/employer/randomization.html). All SSNs issued on or after June 25, 2011 are generated as follows. \n",

In fact you bet over and over again, hoping for a win. Assume that the bets are independent of each other. Find the smallest number of times you have to bet so that your chance of winning at least once is at least 1/2, and then use an appropriate approximation to explain why the answer is roughly a linear function of $M$ when $M$ is large.\n",

Note that unless otherwise specified, coins in this course are assumed to be fair, and thus all sequences of $n$ heads and tails are equally likely. Fix an integer $k$ such that $0 \\le k \\le n$, and fill in the blanks with expressions that evaluate to integers:\n",
